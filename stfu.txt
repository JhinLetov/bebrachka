I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed

I wipe it off the tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3-D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
